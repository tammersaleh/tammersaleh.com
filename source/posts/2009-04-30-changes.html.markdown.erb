I've worked in a few different types of environments in my career ([academia](http://www.seismolab.caltech.edu/earthquakes.html), [start-ups](http://citysearch.com), [Japan](http://www.jetprogramme.org/), [doing good](http://www.ladhs.org/wps/portal/), [working for the man](http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/), etc), but I can honestly say that I've never enjoyed my work, or my coworkers, as much as I have while I've been working with the team at [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com).

Thoughtbot understands the Ruby on Rails culture in a way that I've always respected.  As a company, they focus on producing good work for both the clients and for the community.  As a team, they foster an incredible amount of camaraderie and team spirit, without needing to stifle differences of opinion.

### Setting out

All of this has made my recent decision to leave the company incredibly difficult.  While Thoughtbot has been the best environment I could have hoped for, the need to set out on my own and build something for myself was just too strong.

I will be doing agile Ruby on Rails consulting for a few clients, and will soon focus on developing my own suite of products.  While I'm currently fully committed, I'd be happy to [discuss new opportunities](mailto:me@tammersaleh.com) and give referrals.  I will also be posting my journey, and my development thoughts here, so stay tuned.

*If you're an incredible developer, and interested in living in the Boston or NYC areas, then I cannot recommend a better company [to work for](http://thoughtbot.com/jobs).*
