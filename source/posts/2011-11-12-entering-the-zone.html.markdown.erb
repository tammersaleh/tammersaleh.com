Pool is an impossible game. I'm not saying that it's hard.  I'm saying that the ability to whack a warped three foot stick into a set of 20 year old marble balls on a surface as flat as the Sahara, getting them to collide with great force, gracefully curving and banking around obstacles, and finally making the target ball into the target pocket is **absolutely ludicrous**.  

It's one of the great miracles of human dexterity that we can play the game of pool at all.

I suck at pool.  Well, to be fair, my *sober self* sucks at pool.  In fact, I have a specific range of sobriety during which I am Pretty Damn Good at pool.  That range is between two to five whiskies.  I could be a pool shark if I could get that second number higher.  Give me three whiskies and play [Bad to the Bone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7VsoxT_FUY), and I'll kick your ass.

When I was a kid in high school, I used to do my math homework in the back room while listening to Led Zeppelin I and II on repeat.  I love those albums, and still think they contain some of the best Blues around.  But eventually a Pavlovian thing happened. They put me in The Math Zone.  I almost couldn't do math without them.  Great for homework, but terrible for the big tests.

When I play drums, I have to take my shoes off.  Can't run that last stretch of mile without [Domination](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lXXvUIEy2o). [Burt Bacharach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28kY1-s-Vc) needs to be on the stereo when I make love.  Can't fall asleep without reading SciFi.  Can't read SciFi without falling asleep.

The Zone is fundamental.  A dev in The Zone is a tornado of effectiveness.  Rands has spent tens of thousands of dollars [on his Geek Cave](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/07/10/a_nerd_in_a_cave.html), just to help him get into The Zone, and he hasn't regretted a cent.
