title: I heart Ruby
description: A man falls in love with a language.

A friend of mine pointed out an article on lj a while ago, [Why Python](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3882), and asked for a response...   so now you're all getting it.

I'm pretty sure that I would have been (almost) as impressed with Python as I have been with Ruby...  I just happened to run into Ruby first.  Both these languages are so wonderful to use because of their [dynamic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_language) nature.

Notice that "almost" up there?  Ruby does have a few really neat tricks that (if used correctly) can be really useful.  Granted, most of the time they aren't gonna be used correctly.  Here's a good example, though (found throughout the net):

~~~ ruby
fib = Hash.new do |h,n|
  if n <= 1
    h[n] = n
  else
    h[n] = fib[n-1] + fib[n-2]
  end
end

fib[10] # returns Fibonacci of 10 (55)
~~~

The Hash object can take a block of code during instantiation that it will execute if you reference a non-existent index.  So the code above computes the fibonacci sequence using caching (or [memoization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) or [dynamic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), depending on what pretentious fuck you're talking to).  Meaning that the next time I ask for `$fib[10]`, it's already been computed.  That's the simplest way to do memoization that I've ever seen.

Since Ruby is a [functional language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_language), you can also do neat (but uselessly obscure) things like:

~~~ ruby
puts case
       when x < 0;            "x < 0"
       when 0 <= x && x < 1;  "x in interval [0,1)"
       when 1 <= x && x < 2;  "x in interval [1,2)"
       when 2 <= x;           "x >= 2"
     end
~~~

Which puts (like print) the results of the case statement.  Like all things geeky, this can be used for good or evil :)

Ruby seems to take all the best parts of [LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_language), but bringing them into an easy to use and modern language.

Finally, I agree whole heartedly with everything ESR said about perl.  It's amazing to me that [Citysearch](http://citysearch.com) (and many other large sites) are built entirely out of perl code.  How do they manage to keep their sanity?
