title: ! 'Engine Yard University: Zero to Rails 3'
description: An announcement on the Engine Yard University training program.
---

For the past few months, I've been working on something pretty exciting: [Engine Yard University](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/announcing-engine-yard-university-zero-to-rails-3).

Engine Yard came to me to produce their training curriculum, and their first course, [Zero to Rails 3](http://www.engineyard.com/services/university) is now live.  *Zero to Rails 3* is a three day, hands on workshop in San Francisco taught by [Randall Thomas](http://www.evilmartini.com) and myself.  

With technical help and direction from Yehuda Katz, Ezra Zygmuntowicz, and others, it covers everything you need to get your team started developing successful Rails 3 applications.

> Engine Yard University courses are designed to get enterprise development teams up to speed quickly on Rails, JRuby, Agile development, and other technologies.

Engine Yard University is much more than just this first course.  We're working on a full curriculum for enterprise teams covering everything from Agile to Scaling, and for every member of the team from Ops to Management.  

We'll also be bringing the show to your door.  [Let us know](mailto:me@tammersaleh.com?subject=Engine%20Yard%20University) if you're interested in a custom, in-house workshop for your team.
