title: Shoulda in Advanced Rails Recipes
---

Mike Clark and the Pragmatic Programmers just released the beta version of their latest offering:  [Advanced Rails Recipes: 72 New Ways to Build Stunning Rails Apps](http://pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr).  This is one of the few rails books I've been eagerly waiting for, so you can imagine how honored I was when Mike Clark asked me to review his section on Shoulda.  

#### That's right, folks! Shoulda got its own stake of land in recipe #22:  "Getting Started with BDD."

So head on over and [grab the combo pack](http://pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr).  You get the beta PDF now ('cause none of us respect delayed gratification) and the print book when it ships - all for around $40.
