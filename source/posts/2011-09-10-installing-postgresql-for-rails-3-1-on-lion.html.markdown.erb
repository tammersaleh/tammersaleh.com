**Instructions for installing and configuring PostgreSQL on a fresh Lion installation for use in Rails 3.1**

I recently tried to generate a new Rails 3.1 application based on PostgreSQL on a fresh installation of Lion, and ran into a nasty permission denied issue.  

After piecing together the full solution, I thought a blog post might be helpful for anyone else attempting the same task.  The overview of the problem is that Lion now ships with a PostgreSQL server, so you have to jump through a couple of hoops if you want to use the one provided by [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

### Problem!

I started by installing PostgreSQL through Homebrew:

~~~
# brew install postgresql
# initdb /usr/local/var/postgres
# mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
# cp /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/org.postgresql.postgres.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
# launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.postgresql.postgres.plist
~~~

And then I generated a new Rails 3.1 application, configured to use the PostgreSQL adapter:

~~~
# rails new myapp -D postgresql
  ...bunch of stuff...
  run bundle install (which installs the pg gem)
~~~

I started to see signs of woe when the PostgreSQL commandline tools failed:

~~~
createuser myapp -s
createuser: could not connect to database postgres: could not connect to server: Permission denied
    Is the server running locally and accepting
    connections on Unix domain socket "/var/pgsql_socket/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
~~~

...and, when seeing this in the logs after starting the rails server:

~~~
PGError (could not connect to server: Permission denied
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "/var/pgsql_socket/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
):
~~~

### Solution!

Well, I figured out the problem after a bunch of googling.  Turns out I had two PostgreSQL servers stomping on each other.  The solution is two simple steps, **but the order is important**!

Step one: update the path to give preference to the Homebrew PostgreSQL installation.  My `$PATH` statement in my `.bashrc` looked like this:

~~~
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
~~~

But `/usr/local/bin` needs to be first:

~~~
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
~~~

Now `createuser` works (since we're calling the right one), but that won't fix the rails server connection issue. Turns out `pg` saw the system server when we installed it.  So the second step is simply to reinstall `pg`:

~~~
gem uninstall pg
gem install pg
~~~

And life was again happy.

Much love to [the Stack Overflow conversation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6770649/repairing-postgresql-after-upgrading-to-osx-10-7-lion) that suggested most of this solution.
