title: ! 'Automatic Fancy Ampersands with jQuery '
description: A technique for automatically replacing ampersands with fancy versions using jQuery.
---

Back in 2008, Dan Cederholm posted a great design tip on [CSS-based fancy ampersands](http://simplebits.com/notebook/2008/08/14/ampersands-2/). The basics of this technique is that you surround every &amp; in your headers with a `<span class="ampersand">` tag.  Then, in CSS, you define `.ampersand` as something like the following:

~~~ css
span.ampersand {
  font-family: Baskerville, Palatino, "Book Antiqua", serif;
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: normal;
}
~~~

...or, in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/):

~~~ sass
.ampersand
  :font-family Baskerville, Palatino, "Book Antiqua", serif
  :font-style italic
  :font-weight normal
~~~

Fancy ampersands are one of those little details that adds a subtle aesthetic touch, and gives the page an extra notch of professionalism.  Unfortunately, adding those spans by hand is both bothersome, and error-prone.  It also becomes difficult to make use of this technique for existing or automatically generated content.

#### Luckily, that's why [god](http://ejohn.org/) created [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)!

With a little addition to our `application.js`, we can have fancy ampersands inside all of our header tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.):

~~~ javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
  $(":header:contains('&')").each(function(){
    $(this).html($(this).html().replace(/&amp;/, "<span class='ampersand'>&amp;</span>"))
  });
});
~~~
