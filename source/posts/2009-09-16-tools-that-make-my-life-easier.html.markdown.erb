title: Tools that make my life easier.
description: A list of the tools I use on a daily basis that make my life easier.
---

I've found a zen-like calm recently in my cyber workflow, which means I'm in for a good month of tinkering and futzing around as retribution.  Before that hits, I thought I'd document what I've been using here so I can look back on this post with fond nostalgia.

First, a note about my setup:  I have a Macbook Air and an iMac, both of which I use regularly for development work.  I use them both in an effort to minimize my downtime if one dies or has to go in for repairs.  Because of this, I tend toward online apps and syncing solutions fairly heavily.

### Up top

- **[SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/)**: Rearrange windows like it was 1997 (...back when I ran linux and did this all the time). 
- **[Spirited Away](http://drikin.com/spiritedaway/)**: Great for removing distractions while I Make Money, Yo? 
- **[Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/)**: I'm a paranoid freak about losing important info.  The multi-platform syncing makes Evernote perfect for me. 
- **[Teleport](http://www.abyssoft.com/software/teleport/)**: Lets me use my iMac and Air as if the two were one.  Also, still the best solution I've seen for pairing workstations. 
- **[MenuMeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/)**: Helps me track down which of the myriad of syncing clients is taking up my bandwidth this time.

Some tools that *everyone* already uses: **[Dropbox](https://www.getdropbox.com/)**: The ubiquitous syncing solution.  Some performance problems, but all in all well worth the money.  **[Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com/)**: Srsly...  Who doesn't have this?  **[MobileMe](http://www.apple.com/mobileme/)**: Even with all its foibles, and with Dropbox replacing iDisk, this is a must-have service for me.  **[Time Machine](http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/)**: Because a backup solution is only as good as the restore.

### In my pocket

- **[Mint.com](http://mint.com)**: Here's hoping Quicken doesn't ruin this great service. 
- **[Ego](http://ego-app.com/)**: Cause I've got one. 
- **[Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/)**: Another great time saver, especially with Tweetie integration. 
- **[Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/)**: Gettin' paid, yo? 
- **[ToodleDo](http://www.toodledo.com)**: Uuuuuuugly UI, but does exactly what I want. 
- **[Shredder](http://www.shredderchess.com/)**: I'm not a huge game player, but this is the only chess game I've been able to find that does puzzles.

### Daily apps

- **[MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/)**: Hells, yes! 
- **[PDFpen](http://www.smileonmymac.com/PDFpen/)**: Paid for itself with the first couple of forms I didn't have to print, sign, scan and email. 
- **[OmniGraffle Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/)**: Still my favorite tool for documentation and text layout.  
- **[Mailplane](http://mailplaneapp.com/)**: Fairly good gmail client, and worth it for the drag-n-drop.

Finally, some tools that everyone already knows about: **[Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/)**, **[Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/)**, **[1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password)**, **[Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/)**, and **[Skitch](http://plasq.com/skitch)**.
