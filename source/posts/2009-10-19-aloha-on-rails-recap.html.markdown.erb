By far, the best conference I've been to (or expect to go to) this year was [Aloha on Rails](http://www.alohaonrails.com/).  Not only was the venue as stunning as you'd expect from a conference in Hawaii, but the presentations were equally impressive.  I'm sure it helped to be able to entice speakers like Chad Fowler, Yehuda Katz, Gregg Pollack, Scott Chacon, Corey Donohoe, Ezra Zygmuntowicz and Obie Fernandez by promises of a tropical paradise.

[Chad Pytel](http://www.thoughtbot.com/about/people#cpytel) and I had a great time presenting material from our [upcoming book](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780321620293) on Rails Antipatterns, and we were grateful for the audience praise following the talk.

I also had the honor of being on John Larkowski's [Is Agile too Slow?](http://www.alohaonrails.com/sessions/#is-agile-too-slow) panel.

All of the presentations were incredibly useful, but if I had to choose one for the top of my list, the honor would go to Corey Donohoe's [Everything I Know About Being an Open Source Hacker I Learned From Indie Hip Hop](http://www.alohaonrails.com/sessions/#everything-i-know-about-being-an-open-source-hacker-i-learned-from-indie-hip-hop). 

Congratulations to [Seth Ladd](http://blog.semergence.com/) for orchestrating such a great event.  We're already making plans for next year.
