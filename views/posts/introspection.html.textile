We give "training classes":http://thoughtbot.com/services/training at "Thoughtbot":http://thoughtbot.com, and one of the common issues I've seen is that there are many more examples of good ruby library code than there are of decent Ruby on Rails applications.  A Rails application follows conventions and best practices that aren't relevant to writing library code.

To that end, I've released the "source to this blog":http://github.com/tsaleh/tammersaleh on github.
