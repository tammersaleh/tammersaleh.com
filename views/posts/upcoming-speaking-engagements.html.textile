I'm booked to speak at two upcoming presentations.   If you're going to be coming to either the Scottish Ruby Conference or RailsConf 2010, then be sure to say hi!

At the "Scottish Ruby Conference":http://scottishrubyconference.com/sessions, I'll be presenting "You're Doing it Wrong," an overview of Rails AntiPatterns I've seen in the wild, and ways to avoid or fix them.  Here's an interview I did with "Seth Ladd":http://sethladd.com/ of "Aloha on Rails":http://www.alohaonrails.com/ where I presented the same material:

Chad Pytel and I will be running a three hour tutorial on "Avoiding and Fixing Rails AntiPatterns":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14147 at "RailsConf 2010":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14147.  This is a greatly expanded version of the presentation above, and will go into greater depth on specific AntiPatterns.   We'll also be taking attendee submissions during the class for fixing.

Both of these presentations are samples of the content from Chad and my upcoming "Rails AntiPatterns":http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780321620293 book.
