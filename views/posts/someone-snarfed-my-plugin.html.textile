title: Someone snarfed my plugin!
---

Strangest thing...  looks like someone removed my migration_data_dumper plugin from the "rubyonrails wiki":http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Plugins.

I'm going to do the only reasonable thing and assume that I now have an arch nemesis.  

h3. Arch Nemesis, you've met your match!

Actually, I've been meaning to finally send it over to "RubyForge's":http://www.rubyforge.org svn server anyway ("Site5":http://www.site5.com is decidedly against webDav), so I'll repost it then.  Also got another plugin coming shortly, so drool away.  Maybe I'll do the Omni thing and release hints for about 3 months...
